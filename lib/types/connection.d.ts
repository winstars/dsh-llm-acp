 * Authentication is lazy: `authenticate` runs eagerly only when a configured

 * failure — servers that accept env credentials or a cached login never see
 * an `authenticate` call, so a healthy server never triggers a browser login

 * waits for the operator's `authMethod` selection instead of guessing:
 * methods differ in reachability (codebuddy's intranet-only `iOA` versus its
 * public `external`), so a guess can hang for the whole interactive window.
 * Every handshake and session operation is bounded by its configured timeout
 * so a wedged server fails fast instead of hanging the harness.
