/**
 * `AcpAdapter`: an {@link LlmAdapter} that delegates each model call to a
 * long-lived external ACP server. Subsequent turns within the same dsh session
 * reuse the live ACP session and send only the new user message — the ACP
 * server keeps each session's context and conversation history between
 * prompts, so resending history would duplicate what it already holds. A
 * fresh session is created only when no reuse mapping exists (first turn,
 * one-shot calls) or the history shrank (compaction); one-shot sessions are
 * closed after the prompt.
 *
 * `agent_message_chunk` / `agent_thought_chunk` updates are translated into
 * harness `StreamChunk`s; `usage_update` becomes a `usage` chunk carrying the
 * server's context occupancy on the prompt side. Tool calls are never emitted
 * as `tool-call` stream blocks: the agent loop dispatches such blocks to the
 * harness's own tool registry, but the ACP server already executed them — the
 * host would run them twice or fail on an unknown tool. When the caller
 * supplies a {@link AcpToolCallRecorder} they are logged as `tool/call` +
 * `tool/result` session events instead, which is what renders them as tool
 * cards; without one they degrade to `[tool: …]` reasoning notes.
