/**

 * servers from the volatile `servers` config field (the `llm-acp` settings
 * namespace); each server spawns one
 * long-lived child process and becomes a provider route `acp-<id>`. Servers
 * can be added or removed dynamically through the settings UI without restart.

 * metadata (see `docs/postmortem/0001-acp-default-export-drops-inject.md`).
